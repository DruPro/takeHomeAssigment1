Ecommerce Design Brief Summary — Alan Buenrostro

From zero to shipping an MVP in five days, this project wasn’t just an ecommerce build — it was a deep dive into fast-paced learning, thoughtful architecture, and problem-solving under pressure.

What started as a take-home challenge quickly turned into a solo hackathon. With Vue as the chosen frontend framework (transitioning from my Svelte background), I leaned into simplicity and separation of concerns — opting for vanilla CSS over frameworks like Tailwind to maintain clarity in styling and structure.

The core of the app was built with maintainability, reusability, and testability in mind, particularly around the data-fetching architecture. Components were decoupled from fetching logic to keep things DRY and modular. As the project progressed, I layered in routing, state management via Pinia, and composables to streamline feature growth.

Each day brought challenges — learning Vue's nuances, integrating new features, and managing project architecture under tight timelines. But it all snowballed into a surprisingly rich and performant experience.

Beyond the code, I walked away with stronger convictions about scalable architecture, tool pragmatism ("tools are just tools"), and the importance of starting simple, shipping early, and iterating smartly.

If I had to start over? I’d double down on architectural planning, consistent naming conventions, and accessibility/SEO from the get-go — all of which I now see as critical for scale and inclusivity.

This wasn’t just a coding challenge — it was a crash course in building, learning, and shipping under pressure. Curious to see how it turned out? I think you’ll like what I built.
