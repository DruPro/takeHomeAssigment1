# 🚀 E-commerce Hackathon: A Vue-Powered Take-Home Adventure

**By Alan Buenrostro | May 17 – May 22, 2025**

Welcome to a lightning-fast, five-day design sprint turned hackathon — a take-home assignment that evolved into an immersive deep-dive into Vue.js, clean architecture, and UI craftsmanship. Built from scratch, this ecommerce frontend is more than just a project — it’s a story of learning, persistence, and thoughtful engineering.

### 🌱 The Genesis

What happens when a Svelte developer decides to explore Vue under time pressure? This project. Vue was chosen not just for its capabilities, but for how it challenged and sharpened my frontend skills. Every line of code is a reflection of both strategic decisions and spontaneous breakthroughs.

### 🎨 Styling with Simplicity

Vanilla CSS was chosen over modern utility frameworks to preserve clarity and maintain a clean separation between structure and style. It may be minimal, but it’s deliberate — readable, testable, and scalable.

### 🔄 Data-Driven Design

Data fetching wasn’t an afterthought. With a focus on **maintainability**, **reusability**, and **testability**, the architecture cleanly separates logic from UI — making the codebase easier to debug, extend, and scale. Think composables over chaos.

### 🔧 Under the Hood

* Vue 3 + Vite
* Composition API & Composables
* Pinia (Global State)
* Raw HTML/CSS
* Modular, scalable folder structure
* Clean code principles applied throughout

### 📓 A Developer's Log (aka The Learning Curve)

* **Day 1**: Hit a wall. Vue is powerful — and steep.
* **Day 2**: Breakthroughs in routing and layout.
* **Day 3**: The snowball effect — state, watchers, composables.
* **Day 4**: Discovered the power of global state with Pinia.
* **Days 5–9**: Building, refining, and architecting a reactive frontend.

### 💡 Key Lessons

> “Tools are just tools. Learn to use the tool — don’t just learn the tool.”

This project reminded me to *build first, obsess later*. Vue became a means to an end — not a roadblock. I didn't just read docs. I shipped. And I learned more by doing than I ever could by studying in isolation.

### 🔁 If I Could Do It Again...

* Establish strong architectural specs from day one
* Implement blackbox interfaces and JSdoc annotations
* Standardize component and stylesheet conventions
* Integrate SEO and accessibility best practices early

### 🌐 Accessibility & SEO (In Progress)

While functional, the project sets the foundation for broader web principles:

* Semantic HTML structure
* Keyboard navigation support
* Aria-labels and contrast-aware styling
* Meta tags and clean URL schemes
